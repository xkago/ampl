# ampl
Here you will find solutions to some tasks from the textbooks "Operations Research: Applications and Algorithms" (W. Winston) and "Introduction to Operations Research" (Hillier & Lieberman), which I completed during the course "Introductory modeling for decision-making" using AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language).
Looking at them chronologically, I can see how much better the subsequent solutions are. Still, it is not a compendium of knowledge but only a record of my actions during the course.
Some of them could be done better, but all of them were deemed correct.
